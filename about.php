	        	<p><strong>Catherine Sayles resides in Brooklyn, NY and is a lover of live music, entertaining guests, and her husband David.</strong></p>
				<p>She began her adventure planning events while studying Visual Arts in college in upstate New York. Her creativity and leadership helped her conceptualize and execute some of her campuses most successful events from sold out concerts to all day fundraisers. After wearing many different career hats, circumnavigating the globe and living in both New York and Japan, Catherine decided to meld her passions for being green, and planning events, and thus All Natural Weddings & Events was born.</p>
